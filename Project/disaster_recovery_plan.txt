Disaster Recovery Plan

	The purpose of this plan is to have SQL server up and running, and to be able to overcome data loss after any diaster

	
	Backup and Restore

		Most Basic Option

		1. Backup SQL Server data
		2. Move the backed up data to a neutral off-site location and 
		3. Test restore to assure data integrity 

		SQL Server offers several types of backups including a full backup, differential backup, transaction log backup, and partial backup.

		A Restore strategy shall also be created which will define who will perform restores and how to meet availabilty and data loss goals.


	Database Mirroring

		Increases our availabilty of SQL Server

		1. Maintain two copies of database
		2. Each copy of the database must be on a different SQL Server instance
		3. Two copies of the database form a database mirroring session
			a. One instance is primary server
			b. Other instance is in standy mode, acts as mirror server (has synchronized sessions with quick failover time without data loss)
			c. The principal server is sending the active portion of a transaction log to the mirror server where all transactions are redone
